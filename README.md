# etu-career-connect-app

This project is a web application that allows users to create an account, log in, update their profile information, and view their profiles. The application uses Amazon S3 to store uploaded images and Amazon DynamoDB to store user data.

## Overview

### The challenge

The main challenge of this project was to integrate multiple AWS services, including S3 and DynamoDB, to create functionality for login, signup, and updating information, including profile pictures. This required careful planning and implementation to ensure that the application was secure, scalable, and easy to use.
